    <ul>
    <li>In 1962, a scientist from MIT and ARPA named <span><b>J.C.R. Licklider</b></span> proposed a network of computers that could talk to one another.</li>
    <li>In 1965, another MIT scientist developed a way of sending information from one computer to another by using <span><b>packet switching</b></span>.  Packet switching breaks data down information into blocks, or packets, before sending it to its destination. That way, each packet can take its own route from place to place.</li>
    <li>On October 29, 1969, <span><b>ARPAnet</b></span> delivered its first message between two computers in different locations.</li>
    <li>By the end of the 1970s, a computer scientist named Vinton Cerf created Transmission Control Protocol or TCP which served as a handshake that introduces different, distant computers to each other.</li>
    <li>One of the most transformative world-changing inventions in the history of humanity is the world wide web.  By the early 1990s, the web was basically just an obscure research network invented a few years earlier by an English scientist called <span><b>Tim Berners-Lee</b></span>.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
    <li>University of Illinois computer science student <span><b>Marc Andreessen</b></span> imagined a future where everyone including regular people would use the web as part of our daily lives.  Andreessen soon had a bunch of his college programming pals working on making the web easier and more intuitive to use by adding images, pictures, audio and video.</li>
    <li>In 1993 they posted their browser, <span><b>Mosaic</b></span>, online and made it a free download.  The browser spread like wildfire from just a dozen downloads to over a million and caught the eye of Silicon Graphics’ Jim Clark.  He contacted Marc Andreessen and proposed starting a new software company to turn Mosaic into the basis of a business venture.</li>
    <li>Congress decided that the Web could be used for commercial purposes and opened up <span><b>ARPAnet</b></span> to the public.</li>
